Description: This is an R tool that analyzes a set of single nucleotide 
    variants (SNVs) in a VCF file, along with the associated reference genome, 
    and utilizes a parameter called "context_length" to identify and classify 
    the mutation type for each individual mutation. The toolkit provides 
    flexibility by allowing users to either provide a mutation file or calculate
    mutation types directly from the provided data. The tool is also able to 
    provide a graphical representation of the mutation counts for each specific 
    mutation type.
